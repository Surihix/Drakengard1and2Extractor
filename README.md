# For Developers
- Use the minilz0.dll files included in the libraries folder along with the *MiniLz0Lib.cs* file, to use the minilz0 decompressor in your compiled build.
- If you want to understand the structure of the files that are supported by this tool, then open the file in 010 hex editor and run the appropriate bt template present inside the [010 templates folder](https://github.com/Surihix/Drakengard1and2Extractor/tree/master/010%20templates).
