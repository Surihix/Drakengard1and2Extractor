File Type (.bin) :

This is the format of the main archive files of these games. each of the bin file holds data of a specific category.

Make sure to select the correct game from the "Game Selection: " group before pressing the "Extract BIN" button. 

Once you have clicked the button, you will be prompted with a choice on whether to generate paths if a lst file is 
present inside the bin file. refer to the explanation given for the "File Type (.fpk):" section. as of now only the 
movie bin files have the lst file and if you are extracting a movie bin file, then select the "YES" option in the choice messagebox.


When you are done selecting a valid bin file, the extraction process should begin and all of the files inside the bin file 
will extract inside a "BIN-FILENAME_extracted" folder which would be present next to the bin file that you had selected. 

A trimmed version of the bin file will be created inside the extracted folder which will be used for the extraction process.
You need not have to extract this trimmed bin file again with the extract button.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



File Type (.fpk) :

Majority of the files stored inside the "image" category bin files, will extract with this particular format. 
The fpk file is a archive type file that can hold other type of files or even more fpk files inside it. the "Extract FPK" button should 
extract the files that are stored inside this archive file. once you have clicked the button, you will be prompted with a choice on whether to 
generate paths if a lst file is present inside the fpk file.

The lst files contain the filenames and the virtual path of each file that is stored inside the fpk file. unfortunately these lst files aren't 
always present in all the fpk files and so the path generation function will only work if the lst file exists.

The path generation function is highly experimental and choosing the "YES" option in the choice media, will allow it to try and generate the 
paths from the lst file by creating the appropriate directories inside a #Generated_Paths folder, which will be created inside the extracted fpk folder.
 
The files will first extract without the paths inside the extracted fpk folder and after that the path generation function will try and generate the paths
for each of the extracted file. once each file path is generated, they will be copied over into the #Generated_Paths folder. 


3d Model fpk files:

Some of the fpk files contain 3d model data and for these fpk files, you can directly use the "Drakengard 1/2 PS2 tool" viewer app from the xentax website,
which allows you to view and dump the model data. whether a fpk file contains model data or not is something that you would have to check yourself manually with that 
viewer app.

That app will only show or export models that are skinned or has a rig. this would include character models, weapon models, and 
few of the environment prop models.

When you are done determing and selecting a valid fpk file, the extraction process should begin and all of the files inside the fpk file 
will extract inside a "FPK-FILENAME_extracted" folder which would be present next to the fpk file that you had selected.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



File Type (.dpk) :

Files inside the "image" category bin file from Drakengard 2 will extract with this particular format. the "Extract DPK" button should extract this 
particular file type. 

When you are done selecting a valid dpk file, the extraction process should begin and all of the files inside the dpk file 
will extract inside a "DPK-FILENAME_extracted" folder which would be present next to the dpk file that you had selected.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



File Type (.kps) :

This is one of the two formats used for text files from both these games. the text characters can be stored in ANSI encoding, Shift-JIS encoding or in 
both of the encodings.

The "Extract KPS" button should extract the KPS file's text data to a text file. once you have clicked this button, you will be prompted with a choice on 
whether to parse the text data in Shift-JIS Japanese encoding. 

Choosing the "YES" option would set the program to parse the character bytes in Shift-JIS encoding and finally converts the parsed bytes to UTF-8. 
Choosing the "NO" option would set the program to parse the character bytes in ANSI encoding and finally converts the parsed bytes to UTF-8.


Due to encoding differences, the following issues can occur in the extracted text file:

1. If the text data contains any of the special characters from ANSI encoding that aren't available in Shift-JIS, then those characters will 
be replaced with dot symbols. the chances of this occuring is a bit rare as most of the kps files do not mix and match different encodings.

2. If the text data contains Japanese characters, and the parsing is set to ANSI, then the characters will appear gibberish and 
not make any sense. if this happens, then let the program parse the text in Shift-JIS. 

When in doubt as to which encoding to use, select the "YES" option when prompted and let the program parse the text data in Shift-JIS encoding. 
experiment with both the options and see which one generates the correct text data in the extracted text file.

The text data would also contain non character bytes which would be represented as hexadecimal numbers inside these # # characters, in the 
extracted text file.

Batch Mode:

This option will open a seperate window by which you can extract/convert multiple fpk, dpk, kps, zim, and spk0 files that are present 
in a folder. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Repack tools:

Warning: these functions are experimental and if you encounter any issues, please feel free to report about it in the github page by opening an issue.

This option will open a seperate window by which you can repack the main .bin files, .fpk files, .dpk files and .kps files. 

After you are done repacking these files, you have to build a new PS2 iso file with the modified files.

You can roughly follow along this guide linked below and create your modified PS2 iso file:
https://github.com/DoC-Research/Documentation/wiki/%5BGuide%5D-Rebuilding-Game-iso-with-modified-files


Repacking notes:

1. When repacking a .bin, .fpk and .dpk type files, you have to select the .bin, .fpk or .dpk file first and then select the unpacked folder for that selected file.

2. Ensure that there aren't any similarly named files in the unpacked folder before repacking. 
   For example, imagine there is a file called 'FILE_5.zim' in the unpacked folder and you have another file called 'FILE_5.bmp' in the same folder. the presence 
   of this file will cause the repacking function to incorrectly pick it for repacking, when it should instead pick the .zim file. 
   If you are finding it hard to keep track of the files, you can create a sub-folder inside the unpacked folder and keep the similarly named files inside it.
   By doing so, the tool will not pick that file during the repacking process.
   
3. When repacking .kps files, you will be prompted to select the extracted text file and after selecting that, the repacking function will repack 
   it to a .kps file.
   
4. After a repacking function is done, the original file will be backed up and be renamed with a .old file extension.

File Type (.zim) :

This is the format used for image files from both the games.

Use the "Convert ZIM" button in the app and select a zim file. once a valid zim file is selected, you will be presented with a window 
having options to convert and save the image file to commonly viewable image format like bmp, dds or png. 

Once you are done setting up the parameters in the converter window, click on the "Convert" button and the image file will be converted and saved next 
to the zim file that you had selected.


Notes on image conversion:

1. When saving the image in dds or png formats, increase the Alpha Compensation value to retain some of the image details that would 
   otherwise get hidden with the default alpha channel value. optimal value to use would be 100.

2. If in case the converted image looks corrupt or messed up, tick the "Unswizzle 8bpp image data" checkbox and then click the convert button to 
   convert the image again.	 

3. The converted dds formats will only open on image viewer apps that support R8G8B8A8 DDS format. image editing apps like GIMP or 
   Adobe PhotoShop, should be able to open this image file.

4. When converting a 4bpp image to dds or png, do not adjust the Alpha Compensation value. a warning messagebox will appear if your selectd zim file 
   is a 4bpp image.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



File Type (.spk0) :

This is the format used for skybox related data and for skybox image files. 

Use the "Convert SPK0" button in the app and select a spk0 file. once a valid spk0 file is selected, you will be presented with a window 
having options to convert and save all of the extracted image files to commonly viewable image format like bmp, dds or png. 

Refer to the "Notes on image conversion:" points provided for the zim file type explanation. ignore the second point as it does not apply 
for skybox image files.

Once you are done setting up the parameters in the converter window, the SPK0 file should begin extracting and all of the image files
will be converted and saved in the format that you have selected in the converter window.

The files will all extract inside a SPK0-FILENAME_extracted folder which would be present next to the spk0 file that you had selected.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



File Type (.pss) :

Files inside the "movie" category bin files will extract with this particular format. these files are pre rendered video clips that are 
commonly known as FMVs.

Install PSSPlex and use the Demultiplex option in that tool on the .pss files. this will convert the file to a video format that is supported 
by most media players.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



File Type (.cads) :

Files inside the "SNDIMG", "BGM", or "VOICE" category bin files will extract with this format. these are audio files that are 
used only for the game's music and voice over files.

Use vgmstream to convert the .cads file to .wav format.
Or 
Setup foobar2000 media player and install the vgmstream component to this player. this should allow you to directly play the .cads file inside foobar2000.
